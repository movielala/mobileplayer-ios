A powerful and completely customizable media player for iOS.

![](https://raw.github.com/mobileplayer/mobileplayer-ios/chore/beautiful-readme/introduction.gif)

Features
==================
- Customizable UI. Add a watermark, add/remove/move/resize interface elements, change their appearances and much more.
- Manage multiple player skins and configurations easily. Player view controllers can load configuration data from a local JSON file or remote JSON data. You also have the option to initialize and pass configuration objects programmatically, which allows for greater flexibility.
- 100% documented.

### Future plans
- Well defined and extensive `NSNotification`s.
- Plugin support.
- Pre-bundled analytics plugins for various platforms.

Usage
==================
If you were previously using MPMoviePlayerViewController, changing
```swift
let playerVC = MPMoviePlayerViewController(contentURL: videoURL)
```
to
```swift
let playerVC = MobilePlayerViewController(contentURL: videoURL)
```
is enough. Make sure you don't forget to
```swift
import MobilePlayer
```

## Customizing the Player

In most cases though you would want to customize the player. You can do this by creating a configuration JSON file or programmatically.

### Configuration File

Here is a sample configuration file if you just want to add a watermark to the bottom right corner of the player.

```JSON
{
  "watermark": {
    "image": "CompanyLogo"
  }
}
```

In this case you need to have an image asset named CompanyLogo in your project. After that you create a configuration object using the file and initialize your player using that.

```swift
guard let configFileURL = NSBundle.mainBundle().URLForResource("PlayerConfig", withExtension: "json") else {
  fatalError("Unable to load player configuration file")
}
let playerVC = MobilePlayerViewController(contentURL: videoURL, config: MobilePlayerConfig(fileURL: configFileURL))
```

### Programmatic Configuration

The above example done without using any JSON files looks like the following.

```swift
let playerVC = MobilePlayerViewController(
  contentURL: videoURL,
  config: MobilePlayerConfig(dictionary: [
    "watermark": WaterMarkConfig(dictionary: [
      "image": "CompanyLogo"
    ])
  ])
)
```

### Advanced Configuration

You can edit the player interface completely, add new buttons with custom actions, and way more using configuration
objects and files. Check the MobilePlayerConfig class and other configuration class documentations for a full list of things you can do.

A fully customized player configuration file can look like [this](https://github.com/mobileplayer/mobileplayer-ios/blob/master/MobilePlayerExample/Skin/Netflix.json).

Installation
==================
There are various ways you can get started with using MobilePlayer in your projects.

### [Cocoapods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods)

```
pod "MobilePlayer"
```

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage)

```
github "mobileplayer/mobileplayer-ios"
```

### Git Submodule
Open the Terminal app and `cd` to your project directory. Then run
```
git submodule add git@github.com:mobileplayer/mobileplayer-ios.git
